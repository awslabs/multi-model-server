# Install MMS

## Prerequisites

* **Python**: Required. Model Server for Apache MXNet (MMS) works with Python 2 or 3.  When installing MMS, we recommend that you use a Python and Conda environment to avoid conflicts with your other Apache MXNet or Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) installations.

* **java 8**: Required. MMS use java to serve HTTP requests. You must install java 8 (or later) and make sure java is on available in $PATH environment variable *before* installing MMS. If you have multiple java installed, you can use $JAVA_HOME environment vairable to control which java to use.

For ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre-headless
```

For centos
```bash
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
```

For Mac:
```bash
brew tap caskroom/versions
brew update
brew cask install java8
```

You can also download and install [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) manually if you have trouble with above commands.

* **MxNet**: Recommended. MMS won't install `mxnet` by default. MxNet is required for most of examples in this project. MMS won't install mxnet engine by default, you can install mxnet-mkl or mxnet-cu90mkl based on your need. And you can also choose specific version of mxnet if you want.

```bash
pip install mxnet-mkl
```

or for GPU instance:

```bash
pip install mxnet-cu90-mkl
```


* **Curl**: Optional. Curl is used in all of the examples. Install it with your preferred package manager.

* **Unzip**: Optional. Unzip allows you to easily extract model files and inspect their content. If you choose to use it, associate it with `.mar` extensions.

## Install MMS with pip

To install MMS for the first time, install Python, then run the following command:

```bash
pip install mxnet-model-server
```

To upgrade from a previous version of MMS, run:

```

## Install MMS from Source Code



If you prefer, you can clone MMS from source code. First, run the following command:



```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server.git && cd mxnet-model-server
```

To install MMS, run:


```bash
pip install .
```

To upgrade MMS, run:


```bash
pip install -U .
```




## Install MMS for Development

If you plan to develop with MMS and change some of the source code, install it from source code and make your changes executable with this command:



```bash
pip install -e .
```

To upgrade MMS from source code and make changes executable, run:


```bash
pip install -U -e .
```
