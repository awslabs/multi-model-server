# Deep Model Server

The purpose of **Deep Model Server (DMS)** is to provide an easy way for you to host and serve trained models. For example, you have a model that was trained on millions of images and it's capable of providing predictions on 1,000 different classes (let's say 1,000 different birds for this example). You want to write an app that lets your users snap a picture of a bird and it'll tell them what kind of bird it might be. You can use Deep Model Server to run the bird model, intake images, and return a prediction.

You can also use DMS with **multiple models**, so it would be no problem to add a dog classifier, one for cats, and one for flowers. DMS isn't limited to *vision* type models either. Any kind of model that takes an input and returns a prediction is suitable for DMS. It can run a speech recognition model and a model for a chatbot, so you could have your very own virtual assistant service running from the same server.

Let's talk about what DMS is not. It isn't a managed service. You still need to run it on a host you manage. You still need to manage your input and output pipelines.

## Technical Details

Now that you have a high level view of DMS, let's get a little into the weeds. DMS takes a deep learning model and it wraps it in a REST API. Currently it is bundled with MXNet and it comes with a built-in web server that you run from command line. This command line call takes in the single or multiple MXNet models you want to serve, along with optional port and IP info. Additionally you can point it to service extensions which define pre-processing and post-processing steps. Currently, DMS comes with a default vision service which makes it easy to serve a image classification model. If you're looking to build chat bots or video understanding then you'll have some additional leg work to do with the pre-processing and post-processing steps.

### Supported Deep Learning Frameworks

As of this first release, DMS only supports MXNet. In future versions, DMS will support models from other frameworks! As an open source project, we welcome contributions from the community to build ever wider support and enhanced model serving functionality.

## Serving a Model (TLDR)

We'll get into more detail later, but in the spirit of TLDR, you can get up and running very quickly with the following three steps.

**1. Installation for Python 2 and Python 3**

```bash
pip install deep-model-server
```

**2. Serve the resnet-18 Model for Image Classification**

```bash
deep-model-server --models resnet-18=https://s3.amazonaws.com/mms-models/resnet-18.model
```

TODO: move s3 buckets to dms-models

This will download the model from S3 to the current directory, and serve it with the default options (localhost on port 8080). Also, if you already have run this once and have the model file locally it will use the local file.
You can test DMS and look at the API description by hitting the [api-description](http://127.0.0.1:8080/api-description) endpoint which is hosted at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api-description`.

**3. Predict an Image!**

First, go download a [cute picture of a kitten](https://www.google.com/search?q=cute+kitten&tbm=isch&hl=en&cr=&safe=images) and name it `kitten.jpg`. Then run the following `curl` command to post the image to your DMS.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/resnet-18/predict -F "input0=@kitten.jpg"
```

The predictor endpoint will return a prediction in JSON. It will look something like the following result:

```
{
  "prediction": [
    [
      {
        "class": "n02123045 tabby, tabby cat",
        "probability": 0.42514491081237793
      },
      {
        "class": "n02124075 Egyptian cat",
        "probability": 0.20608820021152496
      },
      {
        "class": "n02123159 tiger cat",
        "probability": 0.1271171122789383
      },
      {
        "class": "n02127052 lynx, catamount",
        "probability": 0.04275566339492798
      },
      {
        "class": "n02123597 Siamese cat, Siamese",
        "probability": 0.016593409702181816
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Now you've seen how easy it can be to serve a deep learning model with Deep Model Server! There are several other features which we will now cover in more detail.

## Deep Model Server Command Line Interface
TODO: update this example when help output is updated
```bash
$ deep-model-server
usage: deep-model-server [-h] --models KEY1=VAL1,KEY2=VAL2...
                           [KEY1=VAL1,KEY2=VAL2... ...] [--service SERVICE]
                           [--gen-api GEN_API] [--port PORT] [--host HOST]
```

### Required Arguments & Defaults

Example single model usage:

```bash
deep-model-server --models name=model_location
```

Example multiple model usage:

```bash
deep-model-server --models name=model_location, name2=model_location2
```

`--models` is the only required argument. You can pass one or more models in a key value pair format: `name` you want to call the model and `model_location` for the local file path or URI to the model. The name is what appears in your REST API's endpoints. In the first example we used `resnet-18` for the name, e.g. `deep-model-server --models resnet-18=...`, and accordingly the predict endpoint was called by `http://127.0.0.1:8080/resnet-18/predict`. In the first example this was `resnet-18=https://s3.amazonaws.com/mms-models/resnet-18.model`. Alternatively, we could have downloaded the file and used a local file path like `resnet-18=dms_models/resnet-18.model`.

The rest of these arguments are optional and will have the following defaults:
* [--service mxnet_vision_service]
* [--port 8080]
* [--host 127.0.0.1]

Logging and exporting an SDK can also be triggered with additional arguments. Details are in the following Arguments section.

#### Arguments:
1. **models**: required, <model_name>=<model_path> pairs.

    (a) Model path can be a local file path or URI (s3 link, or http link).
        local file path: path/to/local/model/file or file://root/path/to/model/file
        s3 link: s3://S3_endpoint[:port]/...
        http link: http://hostname/path/to/resource

    (b) Currently, the model file has .model extension, it is actually a zip file with a .model extension packing trained MXNet models and model signature files. The details will be explained in **Export existing model** section

    (c) Multiple models loading are also supported by specifying multiple name path pairs
2. **service**: optional, the system will load input service module and will initialize MXNet models with the service defined in the module. The module should contain a valid class which extends the base model service with customized `_preprocess` and `_postprocess` functions.
3. **port**: optional, default is 8080
4. **host**: optional, default is 127.0.0.1
5. **gen-api**: optional, this will generate an open-api formated client sdk in build folder.
6. **log-file**: optional, log file name. By default it is "dms_app.log".
7. **log-rotation-time**: optional, log rotation time. By default it is "1 H", which means one hour. Valid format is "interval when". For weekday and midnight, only "when" is required. Check https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler for detail values.
8. **log-level**: optional, log level. By default it is INFO. Possible values are NOTEST, DEBUG, INFO, ERROR AND CRITICAL. Check https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logging-levels


## Using the DMS REST API

### Endpoints

After local server is up, there will be three built-in endpoints:

1. [POST] &nbsp; host:port/\<model-name>/predict
2. [GET] &nbsp; &nbsp; host:port/ping
3. [GET] &nbsp; &nbsp; host:port/api-description


### Prediction

**curl Example**

Using `curl` is a great way to test REST APIs, but you're welcome to use your preferred tools. Just follow the pattern described here. If you skipped over it, we've already gone through a simple prediction example where we curled a picture of kitten like so:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/resnet-18/predict -F "input0=@kitten.jpg"
```

The result was some JSON that told us our image likely held a tabby cat. The highest prediction was:

```json
"class": "n02123045 tabby, tabby cat",
"probability": 0.42514491081237793
```

### Ping

Since `ping` is a GET endpoint, we can see it in a browser by visiting:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/ping

Your response, if the server is running should be:

```json
{
  "health": "healthy!"
}
```

Otherwise, you'll probably get a server not responding error or `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`.

### API Description

TODO: Talk about how "API description" is actually an OpenAPI format

To view a full list of all of the end points, you want to hit `api-description`.
http://127.0.0.1:8080/api-description

Your result will be like the following, and note that if you run this on a server running multiple models all of the models' endpoints should appear here:

```json
{
  "description": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1:8080",
    "info": {
      "title": "Model Serving Apis",

                "type": "object"
              }

          "operationId": "ping",
          "produces": [
            "application/json"
          ],
          "responses": {
            "200": {

                "type": "object"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "/resnet-18/predict": {
        "post": {
          "consumes": [
            "multipart/form-data"
          ],
          "operationId": "resnet-18_predict",
          "parameters": [
            {

            }
          ],
          "produces": [
            "application/json"
          ],
          "responses": {
            "200": {
              "description": "OK",
              "schema": {
                "properties": {
                  "prediction": {
                    "type": "string"
                  }
                },
                "type": "object"
              }
            }

      }
    },
    "schemes": [
      "http"
    ],
    "swagger": "2.0"
  }
}
```

## Using the API with Swagger

TODO: provide more context and info on how/why

  ```python
  import swagger_client
  print swagger_client.DefaultApi().resnet18_predict('white-sleeping-kitten.jpg')
  ```
  ```
  {
    'prediction':
      "[[{u'class': u'n02123045 tabby, tabby cat', u'probability': 0.3166358768939972}, {u'class': u'n02124075 Egyptian cat', u'probability': 0.3160117268562317}, {u'class': u'n04074963 remote control, remote', u'probability': 0.047916918992996216}, {u'class': u'n02123159 tiger cat', u'probability': 0.036371976137161255}, {u'class': u'n02127052 lynx, catamount', u'probability': 0.03163142874836922}]]"
  }
  ```


## Serving Multiple Models with DMS

Here's an example for running the resnet-18 and the vgg16 models using local model files.

```bash
deep-model-server --models resnet-18=file://models/resnet-18 vgg16=file://models/vgg16
```

This will setup a local host serving resnet-18 model and vgg16 model on the same port, using the default 8080.


## Defining a Custom Service

TODO: provide many more examples of pre & post processing.

By passing `service` argument, you can specify your own custom service. All customized service class should be inherited from MXNetBaseService:

```python
   class MXNetBaseService(SingleNodeService):
      def __init__(self, path, synset=None, ctx=mx.cpu())

      def _inference(self, data)

      def _preprocess(self, data)

      def _postprocess(self, data, method='predict')
```

Usually you would like to override `_preprocess` and `_postprocess` since they are bound with specific domain of applications. We provide some [utility functions](https://github.com/deep-learning-tools/mxnet-model-server/tree/master/mms/utils) for vision and NLP applications to help user easily build basic preprocess functions.
The following example is for resnet-18 service. In this example, we don't need to change `__init__` or `_inference` methods, which means we just need override `_preprocess` and `_postprocess`. In preprocess, we first convert image to NDArray. Then resize to 224 x 224. In post process, we return top 5 categories:

```python
   import mxnet as mx
   from dms.mxnet_utils import image
   from dms.mxnet_model_service import MXNetBaseService

   class Resnet18Service(MXNetBaseService):
       def _preprocess(self, data):
           img_arr = image.read(data)
           img_arr = image.resize(img_arr, 224, 224)
           return img_arr

       def _postprocess(self, data):
           output = data[0]
           sorted = mx.nd.argsort(output[0], is_ascend=False)
           for i in sorted[0:5]:
               response[output[0][i]] = self.labels[i]
           return response
```

## Exporting Models for Use with DMS

While all of these options are super exciting you've probably been asking yourself, so how do I create one of these fabulous model files? We'll provide some MXNet examples since that's the current level of support.

There are two main routes for this: 1) export a checkpoint or use the new `.export` function, or 2) using a DMS Python class to export your model directly.

The Python method to export model is to use `export_serving` function while completing training:

```python
   import mxnet as mx
   from mms.export_model import export_serving

   mod = mx.mod.Module(...)
   # Training process
   ...

   # Export model
   signature = { "input_type": "image/jpeg", "output_type": "application/json" }
   export_serving(mod, 'resnet-18', signature, aux_files=['synset.txt'])
```

Another route is to use some new features in MXNet.

```python
net = gluon.nn.HybridSequential() # this mode will allow you to export the model
with net.name_scope():
    net.add(gluon.nn.Dense(128, activation="relu")) # an example first layer
    # then add the rest of your architecture
net.hybridize() # hybridize your network so that it can be exported as symbols
# then train your network
net.export('models/mnist') #export your model to a specific path
```

Note: be careful with versions. If you export a v0.12 model and try to run it with DMS running v0.11 of MXNet, it may server will probably throw errors and you won't be able to use the model.

## Deep Model Export Command Line Interface

Another important tool is packaged with DMS. This is `deep-model-export`, which can take model checkpoints and package them into a `.model` file that can then be redistributed and served by anyone using DMS.

Example usage with the resnet-18 model you would have downloaded in the first example:

```bash
deep-model-export --model-name resnet-18 --model-path models/resnet-18
```

### Arguments

1. model-name: required, prefix of exported model archive file.
2. model-path: required, directory which contains files to be packed into exported archive.

### Required Assets

#### Assets Overview
In order for the model file to be created, you need to provide these three or four assets:

1. signature.json - required; the inputs and outputs of the model
1. name-symbol.json - required; the model's definition (layers, etc.); name is any prefix you give it
1. name-0000.params - required; the model's hyper-parameters and weights; name must match the name from the previous JSON file
1. synset.txt - optional; a list of names of the prediction classes

**signature.json**

1. **input**: Contains MXNet model input names and input shapes. It is a list contains { data_name : name, data_shape : shape } maps. Client side inputs should have the same order with the input order defined here.
1. **input_type**: Defines the MIME content type for client side inputs. Currently all inputs must have the same content type and only two MIME types, "image/jpeg" and "application/json", are supported.
1. **output**: Similar to input, it contains MXNet model output names and output shapes.
1. **output_type**: Similar to input_type. Currently all outputs must have the same content type. Only two MIME types are currently supported: "image/jpeg" and "application/json".

   Using the resnet-18 example, you can view the `signature.json` file in the folder that was extracted once you dowloaded and served the model for the first time. The input is an image with 3 color channels and size 224 by 224. The output is named 'softmax' with length 1000 (one for every class that the model can recognize).

   ```json
   {
     "inputs": [
       {
         "data_name": "data",
         "data_shape": [0, 3, 224, 224]
       }
     ],
     "input_type": "image/jpeg",
     "outputs": [
       {
         "data_name": "softmax",
         "data_shape": [0, 1000]
       }
     ],
     "output_type": "application/json"
   }
   ```

   The `data_shape` is a list of integers. It should contain batch size as the first dimension as in NCHW. Also, 0 is a placeholder for MXNet shape and means any value is valid. Batch size should be set as 0.

**name-symbol.json**

  This is the model's definition in JSON format. You can name it whatever you want, using a consistent prefix. The pattern expected is `my-awesome-network-symbol.json` or `mnist-symbol.json` so that when you use `deep-model-export` you're passing in the prefix and it'll look for prefix-symbol.json. You can generate this file in a variety of ways, but the easiest for MXNet is to use the `.export` feature or the `mms.export_model` method described later.

**name-0000.params**

  This is the model's hyper-parameters and weights. It will be created when you use MXNet's `.export` feature or the `mms.export_model` method described later.

**synset.txt**

  This optional text file is for classification labels. Simply put, if it were for MNIST, it would be 0 through 9 where each number is on its own line. For a more complex example take a look at the [synset for Imagenet-11k](https://github.com/tornadomeet/ResNet/blob/master/predict/synset.txt).


   If `synset.txt` is included in exported archive file and each line represents a category, `MXNetBaseModel` will load this file and create `labels` attribute automatically. If this file is named differently or has a different format, you need to override `__init__` method and manually load it.


## Dependencies

Flask, MXNet, numpy, JAVA(7+, required by swagger codegen)

## Deployments

### Docker
We have provided a Docker image for an MXNet CPU build on Ubuntu. Nginx and all other dependencies are also pre-installed.
The basic usage can be found on the [Docker readme](docker/README.md).

## Design
To be updated

## Testing

You will need some additional Python modules to run the unit tests.

```bash
sudo pip install mock pytest
```

You will also need the source for the project, so clone the project first.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/deep-learning-tools/deep-model-server.git
cd deep-model-server
```

Then you can run the unit tests with the following:

```bash
python -m pytest mms/tests/unit_tests/
```
