# Model Zoo

These models are using the resnet-18 [signature.json]() and a [synset.txt]() with 1000 image classes from ImageNet.

| Model File | Dataset |
| --- | --- |
| [Inception v3 w/BatchNorm]() | ImageNet |
| [Network in Network (NiN)]() | ImageNet |
| [Resnet-18]() | ImageNet |
| [ResidualNet152]() | ImageNet |
| [ResNext101-64x4d]() | ImageNet |
| [SqueezeNet v1.1]() | ImageNet |

## TBD

These models need correct signature files (serving fails).
