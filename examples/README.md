# MMS Examples

The following are examples on how to create and serve model archives with MMS.

* Gluon Models
    * [AlexNet](gluon_alexnet) - train a custom Gluon model, use model archiver, then serve the model archive with MMS
    * [Character CNN](gluon_character_cnn) - download a pre-trained model that classifies product reviews, use model archiver, then serve the model archive with MMS

* Symbolic Models 
  * [Image Classification with SqueezeNet](mxnet_vision) - download a pre-trained computer vision model, use model archiver, then serve the model archive with MMS
  * [LSTM with PTB](lstm_ptb) - download a pre-trained LSTM model that generates text, use model archiver, then serve the model archive with MMS
